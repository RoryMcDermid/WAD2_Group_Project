# Installing VirtualEnv

1) cd to folder and create a virtual environment using the following command and follow the instructions: conda create -n ArtyParty python=3.9. You can replace “rango” with another virtual environment name if you prefer. The command prompt will not activate your new environment automatically, so you need to run the
following command to activate it: conda activate ArtyParty
2) see [this](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_freeze/) page to install from requirements .txt
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
